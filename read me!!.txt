Hey There

He is an app I whipped together in about 3 hours. I know that It is a bit shaky at the moment but I'm gonna have some fun features in it soon.

My Idea was that I would get a fully working app that looks just like microsofts notepad. I would then add features to it that would manipulate the progam in a user defined way.

future updates include:

cd tray ejection include
force windows shut down
mouse manipulation
message box design controll
auto key logger (THE KEY LOGGER WILL REMAIN ACTIVE AFTER THE NOTEPAD IS CLOSED!!)

HOW TO USE
###############

Load the GloatPad and go to the help menu/about notepad
here you are given the controll box.

change the options as you see fit (have a play)

the timer is in seconds (you can have values between .1 and 60)

noting will start until the text pad is used.....try it

mail me to tell me your opinions.
