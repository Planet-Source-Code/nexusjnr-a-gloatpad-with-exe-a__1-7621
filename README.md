### Description

This code is an example of using timer events and controll arrays. What this file does is displays different messages at different intervals on the text area of this notepad like application. They do not activate (the messages) until a user types in the screen. A user can specify which messages he/she wants shown on screen by pressing F5 to get to the controll box. There are a few options at the moment and I plan to have lots more. Have a go!!
